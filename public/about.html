<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Its my first day of writing journal. I can't even call it proper journal as I have no idea what a journal looks like,
  I
  have never read a journal before.

  I'm Shubham Sinha, and I now started enjoying journey of self help and improvement. Been trying hard for last couple
  of
  days to find a way to earn quick money and career to succeed now I have stopped myself for subtle changes in my life.
  there's a lot I needed to write I'll do it everyday. this journal I started is to understand that maybe self
  reflective
  and gratitude journal is maybe something subtle yet I should consider. Today I looked for different ways once again.
  and
  in the end I decide I have stop myself and be strict a bit I can't lose my focus once again like I have always been
  doing for couple of years.

  this journal is of everything about me, not just gratitude journal. I may have countless flaws and I may not be able
  to
  sense a single good thing within myself, but maybe this self acceptance that how I even accept my flaws is exactly the
  one and only good thing within me and I should make good use of it instead of letting this cruel world use me and
  throw
  me away.

  I am willing to try harder, I have tried many times and failed to kept my concentration end up losing so hard. but
  recently I did a very big mistake, something I cannot hide for a long run and so I wanna change myself and do my
  hardest
  this time. keep reminding myself that I have to push myself yet have to remain calm as well. I can't get panicked I
  needed to understand myself and improve myself, past is past I have to always look forward for brighter future and I
  am
  willing to do it now, no matter what this time I will succeed.

  I am going to make a proper routine for myself schedule all the learning materials properly to get best benefits for
  myself and then think of making it perfect when I finally succeed in keeping streak of at least 21 days.</p>
